24,fr.tvbarthel.apps.cameracolorpicker,A Google user,"Near perfect execution. This app has made me realize how difficult it is to identify color in the real world. Light and shadows are constantly at work. The only thing I could suggest is a tool to get an average color from a larger portion of the image. I'm still playing with the app so if this is already there, then just ignore me. Still gets 5 stars.",5,,,,,,
