0,wiseguys.radar,Weldon Young,"CANNOT RECOMMEND this Canadian radar weather app - on my device the 
animated radar IMAGE IS FAR TOO GRAINY TO BE USEFUL. If you are using a 
very low resolution device you could try it. I installed it, tested it once 
& will now uninstall it.",1,,,,
1,wiseguys.radar,Andrew Goudey,Excellent app... thank you Graham Blanshard.  I have always gone to the Environment Canada website to access the radar for my area.  This makes it so much easier.   Two requests:  1) Can the text for towns be smaller and solid black... the large fuzzy text gets in the way?  2) Can this app include a widget that could then have a permanent page when i swipe to the next page from my home screen?,5,,,,
