5,com.dozingcatsoftware.cameratimer,j s,I downloaded five apps for soft camera timer and you would think it would be an easy thing but it's actually not all the other apps that I downloaded sucked all four other apps soft and couldn't do this basic thing so it's not that easy and I commend this app in the developers for making it easy flawless app that does as advertised which is a self-camera timer so at times it usually like 5 seconds you could trust it to 35 whatever and it does its job great thank you everybody the whole team,5,,,,,
